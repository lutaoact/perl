JENNY ROSS: Well done! 
CLIVE HARRIS: Good morning. Geraldine. 
GERALDINE: Good morning, Mr. Harris. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Jenny, could you ring up Mr. Sakai' s office in Japan? 
We need to set up a meeting. 
Not this week...but the meeting must be before November 3rd. 
I' d like Kate, Don Bradley and Derek to be there. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Clive Harris. 
DEREK JONES: Clive, it' s Derek. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Hello, Derek. What can I do for you? 
DEREK JONES: Could you come down to the development workshop for a second? 
CLIVE HARRIS： Derek, I' m busy. 
DEREK JONES: Come on. It' ll take ten minutes. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Alright I' ve got five minutes. 
I' m seeing Kate Mckenna at eleven. 
JENNY ROSS: Hello, could I speak to Mr. Sakai' s secretary... 
This is Jenny from Bibury Systems in the UK. 
Mr. Harris would like to arrange a meeting with Mr. Sakai. 
I wonder if you could check Mr. Sakai' s European itinerary. 
GERALDINE: Yes...yes...yes...I will make sure he gets the message...Alright...goodbye. 
Ah, Mr. Harris, I' ve just had a call from Mr. Peter' s secretary. 
I' m afraid he' s going to be fifteen minutes late for his appointment this afternoon. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Okay. That' s no problem. 
GERALDINE: Good morning, Bibury Systems. 
GERALDINE: Well, Green can see you at eleven o' clock on Monday. Is that alright? 
No, I' m sorry, on Tuesday he has a meeting in the morning. 
Is the afternoon possible? 
Alright. Thank you. 
GERALDINE: Hello, Bibury Systems. 
DEREK JONES: What do you think? 
CLIVE HARRIS: We' ll miss the launch date. 
DEREK JONES: No, it' ll be on schedule. 
CLIVE HARRIS: February 15th? 
DEREK JONES: It will be ready for February 15th. 
CLIVE HARRIS: We must meet the deadline. 
JENNY ROSS: Kate! Have you got a minute? 
KATE MCKENNA: What' s wrong, Jenny? 
JENNY ROSS: I have a problem. 
I am trying to arrange the meeting with Mr. Sakai. 
He is in the UK for these three days. 
The first, the second and the third of November, but he is only available on the first and the second...that' s the Monday and the Tuesday. 
Clive Harris is in Scotland on the Tuesday and Don can't make Monday morning... 
and you and Derek are both in meetings on Monday afternoon. 
What am I to do? 
KATE MCKENNA: Set up an evening meeting? 
JENNY ROSS: No, Mr. Sakai' s secretary says he has dinner engagements on the second and the third. 
KATE MCKENNA: Monday evening? 
JENNY ROSS: Mr. Sakai arrives at the airport at nine o' clock on Monday morning and it' s a nine hour flight. 
Monday evening is not a good time for the meeting. 
He' ll be jet lagged. 
KATE MCKENNA: Then Derek and I will have to change our arrangements. 
May I see my diary? 
Change our ten o' clock meeting with Mr. Clark. 
Make it at half past eight on the 4th. 
JENNY ROSS: You' re giving a dinner party on the 4th. 
KATE MCKENNA: Eight-thirty a.m., not eight-thirty p.m. 
JENNY ROSS: That' s going to be a long day. 
EDWARD GREEN: Good Morning! 
KATE MCKENNA: Hi, Edward. How' s it going? 
EDWARD GREEN: It' s going very well! 
KATE MCKENNA: You look very happy. 
EDWARD GREEN: I am happy. I met Mr. Smith this morning at eight-thirty. 
KATE MCKENNA: That' s very good. And? 
EDWARD GREEN: Mr. Smith liked Big Boss. 
KATE MCKENNA: Good. 
EDWARD GREEN: But he didn' t like the name. 
KATE MCKENNA: Why not? 
EDWARD GREEN: He says Big boss isn' t a good name. 
He wants to call it Tycoon Tim. But he thinks Big Boss will sell. 
KATE MCKENNA: Well done! It' s your first marketing success. 
KATE MCKENNA: You know Mr. Sakai is coming at ten o' clock, don' t you, Jenny? 
JENNY ROSS: Yes, I do. It' s an important meeting, isn' t it? 
KATE MCKENNA: And the slides are ready, aren' t they? 
JENNY ROSS: Yes, they are. 
KATE MCKENNA: And you have checked the monitor, haven' t you? 
JENNY ROSS: Yes, Kate, I have. 
KATE MCKENNA: Sorry, Jenny, it really is very important. 
DON BRADLEY: Good morning! 
JENNY ROSS: Hello, Don. 
DON BRADLEY: Is everything ready for the big day? 
JENNY ROSS: I think so. 
KATE MCKENNA: Don, I' m worried about the last part of the presentation. Can we talk? 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you very much for collecting me. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It' s a pleasure. Don' t mention it. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Is your hotel okay? 
MR. SAKAI: Yes, thanks. It' s fine. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It is good of you to visit us. 
Thank you for sparing the time. I know you have a busy itinerary. 
MR. SAKAI: It' s a pleasure, Mr. Harris. 
I enjoy coming to Britain. And I am looking forward to my visit to Bibury Systems. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It' s kind of you to say so. 
We' ll do our best to make your visit worthwhile. 
DON BRADLEY: You' re seeing Phil Watson at twelve o' clock about the display unit design. 
Do you understand the problem? 
EDWARD GREEN: No, I don' t. 
DON BRADLEY: These are the rough designs. 
Choosing the right colour is very important. 
EDWARD GREEN: Sorry, could you explain what you mean? 
DON BRADLEY: Well, we need different colours. 
EDWARD GREEN: Ah, do you mean stronger colours? 
DON BRADLEY: Yes, I do. 
This display unit must make an impact. 
It' s very important. 
It must look right for the launch. 
It must look exciting. 
EDWARD GREEN: I understand. 
DON BRADLEY: Well, make sure that Phil understands. 
Also this pictures of Big Boss need to be bigger... 
CLIVE HARRIS: So, we aren' t a very big company...but I think we are very efficient. 
MR. SAKAI: How many people do you employ? 
CLIVE HARRIS: About seven hundred full-time. 
But we take on casual staff when we need them. 
Would you like some more coffee, Mr. Sakai? 
MR. SAKAI: No, thank you. And, please, call me Kazo. 
CLIVE HARRIS: And you must call me Clive. 
So, shall we have a look around? 
MR. SAKAI: That would be very nice. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Then perhaps we could have some lunch. 
And then after lunch some of my senior managers will make a presentation to you. 
Would you like to leave your coat and briefcase here? 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you. 
CLIVE HARRIS: And this is our Sales and Marketing Department. 
I don' t think you have met Kate Mckenna. 
She is Head of Sales. 
KATE MCKENNA: How do you do? 
MR. SAKAI: Kazo Sakai, let me give you my card. 
KATE MCKENNA: Thank you. 
CLIVE HARRIS: And this is Don Bradley. 
DON BRADLEY: Hello, Mr. Sakai. We have spoken on the phone. 
MR. SAKAI: Hello, Mr. Bradley. You are American. 
And what part of America are you from? 
DON BRADLEY: Los Angeles. But I have lived in the UK for five years. I like... /Ah. I have visited ? 
MR. SAKAI: I' m sorry. 
DON BRADLEY: No, please,after you. 
MR. SAKAI: I have been to Los Angeles two or three times. 
It' s an interesting city. 
Well, I hope we have a chance to talk again. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, you' ll be seeing Don at the presentation this afternoon. 
MR. SAKAI: I look forward to that. 
PHIL WATSON: Edward? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes. 
PHIL WATSON: Hi, Edward. 
EDWARD GREEN: Hello. 
PHIL WATSON: Phil Watson. Good to meet you. 
Have you been waiting long? 
EDWARD GREEN: Not really. 
PHIL WATSON: Sorry, I was delayed. 
Shall we get straight down to business? 
EDWARD GREEN: Why not? 
PHIL WATSON: Follow me. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, let me introduce you to Mr. Sakai from Detmore Systems. 
Mr. Sakai, can I present Derek Jones? 
Derek is our Development Manager. 
DEREK JONES: It' s very nice to meet you, Mr. Sakai. 
MR. SAKAI: Hello, Mr. Jones. I' m sorry to interrupt your work. 
DEREK JONES: Not at all. I like meeting visitors. 
You' re very welcome. Please make yourself at home. 
MR. SAKAI: So this is the development workshop? 
DEREK JONES; Most of our products start here and this is our latest product, Big Boss. 
MR. SAKAI: Ah, yes. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, we think Big Boss will be very successful. 
MR. SAKAI: And what does he do? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Say hello. 
BIG BOSS: (IN JAPANESE) Hello, Mr. Sakai. Welcome to Bibury Systems. 
MR. SAKAI: Ah, he speaks Japanese. 
DEREK JONES: He also listens. 
And by changing the chip he understands and speaks any language. 
BIG BOSS: How are you fixed for lunch? 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you, but I have another engagement. 
BIG BOSS: Okay, another time, maybe. 
PHIL WATSON: So, you say you want stronger colours. What about this? 
EDWARD GREEN; I' m not sure about this one, are you? 
PHIL.WATSON: No. 
EDWARD GREEN: Could we have these two colours? 
PHIL WATSON: Yes, but those two colours together? 
EDWARD GREEN: Ah right. 
CLIVE HARRIS: So, what kind of food do you like? 
Italian? Or there is a very good French restaurant close to the office. 
MR. SAKAI: Whatever you recommend. 
I like eating all kinds of food. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Then let' s go to the French restaurant. 
Geraldine, please confirm lunch for two at Rene' s and cancel the other reservations. 
GERALDINE: Okay, Mr. Harris. 
Hello. I' m calling from Bibury Systems. 
I' d like to confirm our reservation for two people at 12.30 please. 
The name is Harris. 
Thanks a lot. Goodbye. 
CLIVE HARRIS: By the way, are you free this evening? 
MR. SAKAI: Yes, I am. 
CLIVE HARRIS: My wife and I are going to the theatre this evening. 
Would you like to join us? 
MR. SAKAI: That' s very kind, but no thank you. 
I love going to the theatre, but travelling makes me very tired. 
Tonight I must sleep. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Geraldine, we' ll be back for 1.45. 
MR. SAKAI: I must tell you Clive, Big Boss made me smile. 
DON BRADLEY: Let' s have a run through. We must get this right. 
First we have the introductions and the agenda. 
Second I talk about the background. 
Company growth, staffing levels, return on investment, turnover, and pre-tax profit. 
Third Derek, you talk about the product range. 
At this stage of the presentation we want to present a broad company profile. 
Don' t give too much detail about specific products. 
DEREK JONES: Okay Don. I' ll describe the range and say which products are successful. 
DON BRADLEY: Good. Mr. Sakai may want to discuss certain products, so be ready for that. 
At the end of this section of the presentation I will ask Mr. Sakai if he has any questions. 
We won' t discuss research and development at this stage. 
That will come at the end. 
Then Kate, you talk about major markets and sales strategy. 
Is everything ready? 
KATE MCKENNA: Everything is ready. And rehearsed. 
PHIL WATSON: Right, the product title goes here... 
Just remind me, is the product called Big Boss or The Big Boss? 
EDWARD GREEN: Big Boss. 
PHIL WATSON: Okay. These letters? 
Or these black letters? 
EDWARD GREEN: No, I don' t like those letters. 
PHIL WATSON: Okay. These? 
EDWARD GREEN: Can they be larger? 
PHIL WATSON: Yes. Like this. 
It looks good like that. 
EDWARD GREEN: Excellent. It' s very clear. It' s easy to read. That' s what I want. 
DON BRADLEY: Again, welcome to Bibury Systems. 
We' re very honoured to have the opportunity of making this presentation to you, Mr. Sakai. 
In the next hour and a half, we hope to show that: 
1. Bibury Systems has the right product range for today' s market place, and ambitious plans for the future. 
1、Bibury系统公司的产品对当今市场是畅销对路的，并且也有对未来的宏伟计划。 
2. That our market share in Europe is growing at a steady rate. 
2、我们在欧洲市场的分额在平稳增长。 
3. That our marketing strategy in the US is very successful. 
3、我们在美国的营销策略是很成功的。 
And lastly, 4. That we can be a major player in Far Eastern markets. 
And we are sure that we can be a major player in these markets. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt at any time. 
But first of all, some background information on Bibury Systems. 
As you know, the company was started over forty years ago by Mr. Harris Senior. 
In those early days, the company' s core business was model railways and cars. 
PHIL WATSON: And here we have some copy that tells us what the product can do. 
EDWARD GREEN: "Some toys talk, some toys listen. But Big Boss talks and listens to you." 
PHIL WATSON: And here, and here are the pictures. 
They show Big Boss with the accessories. 
What do you think? 
EDWARD GREEN: The pictures are okay, but I don' t like the copy. 
PHIL WATSON: Why not? 
EDWARD GREEN: It' s not exciting. It doesn' t sell the product. 
PHIL WATSON: "Some toys talk, some toys listen. 
Big Boss talks and listens to you." 
EDWARD GREEN: It' s not the way you say the words, it' s the words themselves. 
They' re not right. 
PHIL WATSON: "Some toys talk, some toys listen ..." 
EDWARD GREEN: No! No! I want new words. 
Words that give Big Boss status. Words that make important. 
DEREK JONES: Let' s move from the general to the specific. 
I' m going to talk about two of our products. 
Friendly Fish and Mad Monkey are two products that use the same mechanism. 
Friendly Fish和Mad Monkey 这两个产品用的是同一个机制。 
It is a simple mechanism... 
But this diagram here shows how well the mechanism works with the design of the product. 
For instance, take a look ... 
EDWARD GREEN: I don' t like the slogan. 
PHIL WATSON: No. It' s no right. 
EDWARD GREEN:"Every office needs a new boss". 
It' s just not right. Any ideas? 
PHIL WATSON: "Some bosses are big; some bosses are small...Big Boss is the best!" 
EDWARD GREEN: No. 
KATE MCKENNA: ...So this slide here shows a total net income from the previous year. 
The blue line represents income from those products in the low volume niche market category. 
The red line represents products in the high volume, low margin category. 
MR. SAKAI: Excuse me, what does the dotted line represent? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' m sorry, this dotted line represents income from accessories and add ones. 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you. And why the sharp decrease in February? 
KATE MCKENNA: This is a combination of two things: 
First, seasonal factors, and second the end of the product life cycle. 
First, seasonal factors, and second the end of the product life cycle. 
We' ll get you some alternatives tomorrow or the day after. 
EDWARD GREEN: No. I think I' ve got it. 
PHIL WATSON: "The one boss your office needs". 
That' s good. That' s the slogan. 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you for your very interesting presentation. 
I would like to tell you one or two things about our operation. 
As you know, we specialise in electronic games. 
We have a very large market share in the Far East. 
We manufacture computerized games for young children. 
Some games are for adults. 
This game for example is the number one best seller in Japan. 
The office workers love it. 
We know the market responds well to any kind of hi-tech executive toy. 
Big Boss can succeed in the same market. 
But there is one question I would like to ask. 
It is possible to launch Big Boss before January 28th? 
DON BRADLEY: January 28th? 
KATE MCKENNA: January 28th! We can' t make that deadline. 
DON BRADLEY: Yes, we can. It' s difficult but it' s possible. 
KATE MCKENNA: I don' t know. We' re launching The Mad Monkey on January 26th. 
DON BRADLEY: We can re-schedule the launch of Mad Monkey, can' t we? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' ll have to talk to the distributors as soon as possible. 
DON BRADLEY: When can you go and see them? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' ll have to take the first flight I can. 
MR. SAKAI: The presentation was very interesting. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Thank you. 
MR. SAKAI: There are exciting possibilities for both our companies. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, I think so. 
We have a lot to discuss, don' t we? 
MR. SAKAI: Yes, we do. 
I would like to stay an extra day if that is possible. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I would be delighted. 
We can arrange everything. 
What is your itinerary? 
MR. SAKAI: I am scheduled to fly to Frankfurt tomorrow morning at seven. 
Would it be possible to find out if there is an afternoon flight? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Of course. I' ll do that now. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Jenny, we need to check flights to Frankfurt for Sakai-san... 
PHIL WATSON: So that' s excellent. We agree on the design. 
I think those colours will work well together and the lettering looks good. 
EDWARD GREEN: I think Don will be very happy with this but I' ll confirm by fax tomorrow morning. 
PHIL WATSON: And when is your deadline? 
EDWARD GREEN: Everything must be ready for the launch on February 15th.

Your flight back to Japan is on Saturday at twenty with a stop over in Dubai at the airline' s expense.

MR. SAKAI: Thank you very much, Jenny. 
JENNY ROSS: My pleasure, Sakai-san. 
MR. SAKAI: I hope to return your hospitality when you come to Japan next month. 
DON BRADLEY: Derek? 
DEREK JONES: Uh huh. 
DON BRADLEY: Can I ask you a quick question? 
DEREK JONES: Fire away. 
DON BRADLEY: Can you make this January 28th deadline? 
DEREK JONES: Who knows? 
It' s difficult to say because there is a lot of work to do. 
DON BRADLEY: Well, it' s getting late. 
I' m going home. We' ll talk tomorrow. 
See you in the morning. 
DEREK JONES: Good night. 
CAR HIRE CLERK: The courtesy bus outside will take you to your car. 
You' ll have a nice day now. 
How can I help you? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' d like to hire a car. 
CAR HIRE CLERK: For how long? 
KATE MCKENNA: Just for twenty-four hours. 
CAR HIRE CLERK: Which category of car would you like, madam? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' d like the standard four door saloon. 
CAR HIRE CLERK: That' s fine. 
That price includes full collision waiver and unlimited mileage. 
How are you paying? 
KATE MCKENNA: I have a corporate charge card. 
CAR HIRE CLERK: That' s fine, and may I see your driver' s license, please? 
BIG BOSS: I want to be on the market by January 28th. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Good evening, madam. 
KATE MCKENNA: Good evening. I have a reservation. 
The name is Mckenna. A room for one night. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' ll just check. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' m sorry but there' s nothing here under that name. 
KATE MCKENNA: Ah, perhaps it' s under the company name.Bibury Systems. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' ll just be a second. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' m sorry there' s nothing down here under that name. 
KATE MCKENNA: Oh, dear. 
Is it possible to book a room for one night, please? 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST; I' m afraid we only have a suite. 
KATE MCKENNA: How much is that? 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: That' s two hundred and eighty dollars including breakfast and sales tax. 
KATE MCKENNA: I' ll take it. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: How will you be paying, madam? 
KATE MCKENNA: Credit card. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: That would be fine, thank you. 
Could you just complete this form, please? 
It' s your home address, 
the registration number of your car if you have one and just put your signature down here. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: It' s the Tower Suite and it' s on the twenty-third floor. 
Would you like to order a newspaper? 
KATE MCKENNA: Yes, please. The Herald Tribune. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' ll have the bell hop see to your bags.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Dinner is served from seven o' clock till ten thirty. 
The dining room is down there, through the door on the left. 
KATE MCKENNA: Thank you. 
GEORGE PEARSON: It' s good of you to see me. 
MR. SAKAI; Not at all. 
I have heard a lot about your company. 
GEORGE PEARSON: Good tings, I hope. 
MR. SAKAI: Oh, yes. 
GEORGE PEARSON: As you know. J.K.Toys has a strong presence in Europe... 
MR. SAKAI: Yes, I saw your sales figures for last year. 
They are very impressive. 
I' m afraid our office is closed until nine o' clock tomorrow morning. 
Please leave your name, your telephone number,the time of your call, 
and your message after the tone. 
KATE MCKENNA: Hi, this is Kate. 
Its seven thirty on Thursday evening. 
I' m at the Tower Hotel. 
Jenny, as soon as you get in could you fax me a copy of the contract we are offering to David Toys? 
Talk to you tomorrow. Bye. 
WAITER: Good evening madam. Do you have a reservation? 
KATE MCKENNA: Do I need one? 
WAITER: No, well that will be okay, I guess. 
Would you like smoking or non-smoking? 
KATE MCKENNA: Non-smoking please. 
WAITER: Would you care to follow me? 
WAITER: I' m Gregory, madam, and I' m your waiter this evening. 
Can I get you your drink while you are making your selection? 
KATE MCKENNA: No, I' ll order right away. 
something light, I think. What' s in your Presidential Chicken? 
WAITER: Our Presidential Chicken, was specially created for Ex-President Gerald Ford. 
It is strips of farm fresh baby pullet lightly steamed 
and served on a bed of leeks garnished with snow peas. 
What goes really nice with it, we think, 
is a fluffy baked Idaho potato with just a tad of sour cream or yoghurt,if you prefer... 
KATE MCKENNA: Just rice, I think. 
WAITER: Would that be white rice, brown rice, wild rice, 
brown and wild rice mixed or Four Seasons Risottino? 
KATE MCKENNA: Plain, boiled, white rice. 
WAITER: Plain boiled white rice. 
And for your beverage, madam? 
We have a nice California Chardonnay... 
KATE MCKENNA: No, I' ll have a mineral water. 
WAITER: Carbonated or non-carbonated? 
KATE MCKENNA: Carbonated. 
And the fresh tomato soup to start. 
GEORGE PEARSON: I know that you are interested in Bibury Systems... 
MR. SAKAI: News travels fast in the toy industry. 
GEORGE PEARSON: We heard that you' re interested in a new product that Bibury Systems are launching... 
MR. SAKAI: I am interested in any innovative product, Mr. Pearson. 
GEORGE PEARSON: That' s why I would like to talk to you. 
I don' t know how much you' re heard about recent developments at J.K. Toys.
But we have some ideas that I think you will find very interesting... 
HOTEL WAITER: More coffee? 
KATE MCKENNA: No, thanks. Could I have the bill, please? 
HOTEL WAITER: The check? Sure. 
KATE MCKENNA: And could you charge it to my room? 
I' m in the Tower Suite. 
HOTEL WAITER: Of course. 
KATE MCKENNA: We know that Big Boss is innovative
but Dealer Dan also uses very advanced technology. 
MR. SAKAI: When is the launch date for Dealer Dan? 
GEORGE PEARSON: It will be launched before February. 
MR. SAKAI: And how much will it cost? 
GEORGE PEARSON: Dealer Dan will be cheaper than Big Boss. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: The Leisure Centre. Sure. 
Through the double doors, take a right. 
Down to the end and it' s on the left. 
You can' t miss it. 
KATE MCKENNA I' d like to check out and is it possible to talk to the Manager, please? 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' m afraid the Manager' s not available at the moment. 
But the Assistant Manager is here. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: How can I help you madam? 
KATE MCKENNA: My secretary made a reservation for a standard room, 
but your receptionist says you have no record of the booking. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Ms. McKenna from Bibury Systems. 
Just let me check. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: I' m terribly sorry. Your secretary is right. 
The fax arrived here yesterday afternoon, 
but for some reason it was not entered into the computer system. 
It is entirely our fault. 
Samantha, please prepare Ms. McKenna' s bill again at the standard rate. 
I am sorry about this confusion. 
Please accept last night' s dinner with our compliments. 
EDWARD GREEN: Phil, thanks for coming. 
PHIL WATSON: I' m sorry I' m late. 
EDWARD GREEN: No problem. 
PHIL WATSON: The traffic was very bad. 
EDWARD GREEN: You have been here before, haven' t you? 
PHIL WATSON: Once. A very short visit to Don Bradley' s office. 
EDWARD GREEN: Perhaps I could show you around after the meeting. 
PHIL WATSON: Yes, please. 
EDWARD GREEN: I' ll give you the guided tour. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Thanks for going to Southford Components yesterday. 
DON BRADLEY: It was no problem. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I want to keep Derek working on Big Boss. 
So what did you think of the Southford set up? 
DON BRADLEY: This is their sales brochure. 
They seem quite competent. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Where is it? 
DON BRADLEY: It' s just by the freeway near intersection eight. 
It' s in a large Greenfield site in a new development. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Who did you see there? 
DON BRADLEY: I had a long meeting with the C.E.O. 
They have excellent robotics and a hi-tech production line. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It looks impressive. 
DON BRADLEY: There are their R & D laboratories. 
They have a very big budget. 
They commit five percent of their profit to that department. 
And they' re doing some very innovative work in solar energy. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Okay, so what' s the down side? 
DON BRADLEY: Well, I' m slightly unhappy about a couple of things. 
They are expensive. 
We could buy in components cheaper from another source. 
And they do supply a lot of companies, including one or two of our rivals. 
However they took me out for an excellent lunch! 
CLIVE HARRIS: So what do you think? 
DON BRADLEY: Well, I can see that they' re a strong option, 
but I am seeing a couple of other suppliers next week. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, let' s wait and see. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Come in. 
EDWARD GREEN: Sorry to interrupt but Phil is here with the designs. 
DON BRADLEY: Okay, I' m coming right now. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' m very sorry about Ms. McKenna' s booking. 
It' s my fault. 
How stupid of me. I didn' t check. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Don' t worry about it, Samantha, but please be careful in the future. 
KATE MCKENNA: Sorry to interrupt, 
but before I go, I would like to speak to someone about conference facilities. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Of course. Let me show you what we can offer. 
How many people are involved? 
KATE MCKENNA: I need to arrange a day' s presentation to about sixty agents. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Have you time now to look at our facilities? 
KATE MCKENNA: I' ve ten minutes.Could we do it fairly quickly? 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Of course. You say you need a room for sixty people? 
KATE MCKENNA: Yes, that' s right. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: And it' s a presentation, isn' t it? 
Here' s our main conference room. 
It has excellent projection facilities. 
We have full stereo sound, video, 35 mm slides. You name it, we have it. 
KATE MCKENNA: How much is this for the day? 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: We have a standard rate of $900 per half day which includes coffee and biscuits. 
KATE MCKENNA: That' s quite expensive. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Perhaps we could work something out. 
Shall we go back to my office? 
PHIL WATSON: This is the outline design concept. 
This goes with that and this copy goes on the side of the box over here. 
So, what do you think? 
DON BRADLEY: What do you think, Edward? 
EDWARD GREEN: I think the design is very good. But not for this product. 
DON BRADLEY: I agree. I' m sorry Phil but it seems rather young for our market. 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, it' s very bright. 
It looks really good but Big Boss is a niche product. 
We are targeting the product at the children of well-educated, high income, young professionals. 
And don' t forget we expect adults to buy Big Boss as well. 
GERALDINE: I' m sorry, deliveries are through the side door. 
You go out of the building, turn left, 
and there' s a door on the right hand side marked deliveries. Okay? 
GERALDINE: Hello, Bibury Systems. Oh, hello, Kate... 
CLIVE HARRIS: Is that Kate Mckenna? 
I' ll have a word. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Hello, Kate. How' s your trip?... 
CLIVE HARRIS: Hello, Kate. How' s your trip?... 
Good...We need you back here as soon as possible... 
Good luck! 
GERALDINE: Sorry to disturb you, Derek. 
DEREK: Not at all. 
EDWARD GREEN: Have you met Phil Watson from RUYJ Advertising? 
DEREK JONES: No, I don' t think so. 
EDWARD GREEN: Phil, I' d like to introduce Derek Jones our Development Manager. 
DEREK JONES: Glad to meet you. 
EDWARD GREEN: This whole area is our development workshop. 
It' s where we work on the ideas for new products and toys. 
It' s where we work on the ideas for new products and toys. 
PHIL WATSON: Who gives you the ideas? 
EDWARD GREEN: Most of the ideas come from inside the company... 
PHIL WATSON: Who thought of this? 
EDWARD GREEN: This product here is being manufactured under licence from a company in the States. 
EDWARD GREEN: This product here is being manufactured under licence from a company in the States.不是我们的想法。 
It' s not our concept, I' m afraid. 
But it' s selling very fast. 
We have a very flexible position on licensing deals. 
PHIL WATSON: This looks beautiful. 
EDWARD GREEN: Derek, whose idea was this? 
Did you think of this one? 
DEREK JONES: No, it' s quite nice, isn' t it?
That toy started life as a picture from a young girl from a local school. She sent it in to us. 
Ah, here it is. 
PHIL WATSON: How do you do your market research for a new product? 
EDWARD GREEN: Good question. 
It depends on the product. 
We have our own research people in-house so we do very detailed assessments. 
But, of course, we buy in market research expertise when we look outside the UK. 
Marketing Big Boss is very complicated. 
We' re targeting both adults and children. 
PHIL WATSON: Nice to meet you, Derek. 
DEREK JONES: You too. 
I hope you get the packaging designs right. 
Big Boss deserves the best. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Can I get you a cup of tea or something? 
MS WONG: No, thanks, I' m fine. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Please have a seat. 
Well, Sally, you' re seen the company. You' re seen our products. 
What do you think? 
MS WONG: You have a wide product range, but they' re all dependent on the same chip technology. 
I think we may be able to supply you with some of the necessary circuitry 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, thanks for coming in. 
MS WONG: It has been most interesting. 
DEREK JONES: This is the latest prototype. 
PHIL WATSON: How does it work? 
DEREK JONES: Say something to the boss. 
PHIL WATSON: Like what? 
DEREK JONES: Anything. 
There' s a microphone in Boss' s ear, and it will recognise certain commands. 
It records what you say and stores it. 
When it hears the trigger word, it plays it back. 
PHIL WATSON: I' m sorry, could you repeat that? 
I don' t understand what you mean by trigger word. 
DEREK JONES: Okay, I' ll try to explain it more simply. 
We can programme the Boss to say something like "I don' t want problems, I want solutions". 
And we do that like this: you press his nose and that activates the voice card. 
Then you say the phrase. 
Then you press the nose again. 
PHIL WATSON: Why do you do that? 
DEREK JONES: You do that in order to stop the recording. 
Then you select your trigger word. 
PHIL WATSON: What is that? 
DEREK JONES: The trigger word makes the Boss speak. 
Every time he hears that word, 
he will say "I don' t want problems, I want solutions." 
PHIL WATSON: So, let me clarify this: 
each time the Boss hears the trigger word, he' ll repeat the phrase. 
DEREK JONES: Exactly. 
So give him the trigger. 
PHIL WATSON: Okay ummm ...The trigger can be the word "problems". 
DEREK JONES: Fine. Say it in his ear, then. 
PHIL WATSON: "Problems." 
DEREK JONES: Okay, now say a sentence with the word "problems" in it. 
PHIL WATSON: Excuse me, Big Boss, I' m having some problems with the project. 
BIG BOSS: Problem! I don' t want problems. I want solutions. 
PHIL WATSON: Brilliant! How is it powered? 
DEREK JONES: Aha! You' ll enjoy this: 
light energy. It won' t need new batteries. 
Both the eyes contain photo-sensitive cells which absorb the solar energy. 
These cells then power the motors located here under each arm. 
Now, as everybody knows, when you have this kind of configuration there is a... 
EDWARD GREEN: Sorry, Derek would you mind explaining that in another way? 
DEREK JONES: Sorry. I' ll keep it simple. 
The important thing is that this is a major breakthrough. 
All the toys will represent the very latest in technology. 
PHIL WATSON: I can see that. It' s very impressive. 
EDWARD GREEN: Thanks, Derek. 
PHIL WATSON: Thanks for the demonstration. 
DEREK JONES: Any time. 
MS WONG: Tell me, do these toys work? 
CLIVE HARRIS: These? Yes. 
MS WONG: How old are they? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Some of them are Victorian.
No microchips in these. 
All clockwork, but some of them are quite ingenious. 
Look at this one for instance. 
A young violin player. 
MS WONG: It' s very beautiful. 
How does it work? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, you just wind it up 
grandmother played with some of these when she was a girl. 
And my father collected clockwork toys. 
MS WONG: They are very clever.
CLIVE HARRIS: But not very safe ...Look at the sharp edges on this one. 
Very dangerous and it' s covered with lead paint. 
MS WONG: Tell me, how does this work? 
GERALDINE: I' ve pressed return and nothing happens. 
I' ve tried that. 
How can I get out of the programme? 
Just a second. Could you speak more slowly, please? 
Right. Let me try. 
F1 and then return.Yes, 
then press "escape". 
Oh that' s it. Thanks. 
EDWARD GREEN: ...Let me show you how products are market researched... 
EDWARD GREEN: You see all products go through the same, basic process. 
They start as an idea. 
Every month, a management committee looks at all the new ideas and they put development money into some of them. 
Let me show you an example. 
Take this product: "Friendly Fish". 
The idea came from a freelance designer. 
A Management Committee looked at the designs and they liked them. 
Follow me. 
They asked the development team how much it would cost to manufacture the product, 
and they asked the Marketing Department two questions: 
1. Who is the target market for Friendly Fish? 
1、Friendly Fish的目标市场是哪人? 
2. How big is that market? 
2、市场有多大？ 
We then know if the idea is worth taking on to the next stage which is the feasibility study. 
PHIL WATSON: So what happened with the Friendly Fish? 
EDWARD GREEN: We learned at this stage that it was a low cost high volume mass market product. 
The feasibility study indicated that Friendly Fish would sell all over Europe. 
We then invested in more market research. 
We asked a large group of eight year olds from Different backgrounds about "Friendly Fish". 
We asked them questions like: 
Which material shall we use? 
Which colours do you like? etc. 
A few of the kids wanted it green and blue. 
17.5% other children wanted it red. 
17.5% 的希望是红色。 
But all of them wanted Friendly Fish. 
All of them. They loved Friendly Fish. 
We checked each key indicator. 
Every one of them was positive. 
We made half a million. 
PHIL WATSON: And what are sales like? 
EDWARD GREEN: Terrible. 
Sometimes it happens. 
Even with all the market research, you can never be one hundred per cent certain. 
MR. SMITH: Edward, I' m sorry. 
I' m afraid I' ll have to cancel our meeting tomorrow. 
EDWARD GREEN: That' s no problem. 
Shall we postpone it until later in the week? 
MR. SMITH: No, I' m afraid I' m not postponing our meeting. 
I' m canceling it. 
EDWARD GREEN: We need to sign the contract and complete the deal, don' t we? 
Is there a problem? 
MR. SMITH: No, not for me, but perhaps there' s a problem for you. 
I' m afraid Big Boss won' t be in the catalogue. 
EDWARD GREEN: Are we too late for the printer' s deadline? 
MR. SMITH: No. That' s not the point. 
I' m not going to use Big Boss. 
I' m going to use another product. 
EDWARD GREEN: I don' t understand. 
MR. SMITH: Well, listen. Then you will understand. 
This is a new product from J.K Toys. 
It' s called Dealer Dan. 
DEALER DAN: "Hi, this is Dealer Dan. 
I' m the best thing on the voice-activated toy market." 
MR. SMITH: Edward, are you still there? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes. 
MR. SMITH: Good, isn' t he? 
EDWARD GREEN: You say he' s called Dealer Dan. 
MR. SMITH: Yes. He arrived yesterday afternoon. 
The head of marketing from J.K Toys introduced us. 
J.K.玩具公司的市场营销主管给我们做的介绍。 
They' ll launch him on January 20th. 
EDWARD GREEN: What! Is Dealer Dan solar powered? 
MR. SMITH: Yes. 
EDWARD GREEN: And voice-activated? 
MR. SMITH: Yes. It' s the same technology...but cheaper. 
I think Dealer Dan would just like to say bye-bye. 
DEALER DAN: Bye-bye. 
EDWARD GREEN: I don' t understand... 
DEALER DAN: If you can' t stand the heat get out of the kitchen. 
GERALDINE: I' m afraid Mr. Peter is running a bit behind schedule but he won' t be long. Thank you. 
EDWARD GREEN: Have you seen Don? 
GERALDINE: He' s in the boardroom in a meeting. 
EDWARD GREEN: Something important has come up. 
I need to talk to him. 
GERALDINE: He' s with Mr. Reiley. 
GERALDINE: Go on. 
DON BRADLEY: We' ll get some examples of the display materials to you and there will also be a point of sale video of the product. 
Come in. 
EDWARD GREEN: Don, Mr. Reiley. Sorry to interrupt. 
Something important has come up. 
Can you spare a minute? 
DON BRADLEY: Can it wait? I' ll be through in ten minutes. 
EDWARD GREEN: Not really. 
DON BRADLEY: Okay. I' m sorry. Do you mind if I deal with this? 
EDWARD GREEN: I think we' ve got a problem. 
I have just talked to Mr. Smith on the phone. 
The catalogue deal is off. J.K. Toys are launching Dealer Dan. 
DON BRADLEY: Who the hell is Dealer Dan? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Let' s get this straight. 
You think we' ll meet these targets. 
DEREK JONES: Yes, I do. 
But we' ll need to either increase overtime or take on some causal staff... 
DON BRADLEY: Do you mind if I butt in? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Not at all. What' s the matter? 
DON BRADLEY: I think we need to talk. 
Something very important has come up. 
JENNY ROSS: Do you know where Don is? 
I thought he was in a meeting with a client. 
GERALDINE: He was. But he cut the meeting short. 
There' s a problem. 
JENNY ROSS: What? 
GERALDINE: I don' t know. Something about Dealer Dan. 
DEREK JONES: Everything in Big Boss is new. 
The idea is new. 
The technology is new. 
DON BRADLEY: Maybe Dealer Dan is a coincidence. 
Is that possible? 
DEREK JONES: It' s possible. 
Of course it' s possible, but it is very unlikely. 
CLIVE HARRIS: How many people knew about The Boss? 
DEREK JONES: Well, hundreds of people. 
CLIVE HARRIS: No, I' m sorry, that' s not what I mean. 
I' m talking about the technology. 
How many knew about that? 
DEREK JONES: Well, only the people in my team. 
DON BRADLEY: I think we need to find out more about Dealer Dan. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I' ll make a few calls. 
Don, you set up a meeting with the marketing team and look at our options. 
I' ll get back to you as soon as I hear anything. 
Derek, I want you to get hold of Dealer Dan. 
JENNY ROSS: I' m calling about the meeting scheduled for this afternoon. 
I' m terribly sorry but Don won' t be able to make it. 
Is there any chance that we could re-arrange it for the same time next week? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, I' m really sorry, but it' s absolutely impossible for me this afternoon. 
I' ll have to work late tonight. 
Something has come up. 
JENNY ROSS: Is there any way that Mrs. Clark could bring forward her meeting with Don by an hour? 
I' m trying to re-schedule all of Don' s appointments for tomorrow. 
EDWARD GREEN: Ah, do you have his diary in front of you? 
Good. Could we move the meeting from two o' clock on Thursday to sometime on Friday morning? 
JENNY ROSS: Alright, if you can' t make any time in the next week, 
could we set up a four-way telephone conference? 
GERALDINE: Clive, it' s Mr. Sakai on the line for you. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Mr. Sakai? 
How are you, Kazo? 
MR. SAKAI: Well, Clive, thank you. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It' s nice to hear from you. 
How are the family? 
MR. SAKAI: They are fine, Clive. 
Thank you for asking. 
Clive, can I come to the point very quickly? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Please do. 
MR. SAKAI: I' m very worried. 
I have just seen a new product which is very like the Big Boss. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Really? 
MR. SAKAI: I have changed my plans. 
I' ll be in London tomorrow. 
We must meet. 
My secretary will fax all my travel plans. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, of course, Kazo. 
I' ll meet you at the airport. Goodbye. 
Sally, whatever you have arranged for me tomorrow, it' s cancelled. 
And possibly the afternoon as well. 
DEREK JONES: How much do J.K. Toys know about you and who told them? 
And how good is Dealer Dan? 
DEREK JONES: The technology is the same as ours. 
I have never seen two products which are so similar. 
In concept and design there are no basic differences. 
None. However I have examined the components and the xr590... 
KATE MCKENNA: What is the xr590? 
DEREK JONES: The xr590 is the power source which drives dealer dan. 
I think it has a few weaknesses. 
It' s not as good. 
In my opinion it' s not reliable enough for children. 
don bradley: Exactly how unreliable is it? 
DEREK JONES:Ican' t say exactly. 
I haven' t completed the tests yet. 
It' s too early to say. 
KATE MCKENNA: Will it affect their sales? 
don bradley: Derek? 
DEREK JONES: Not much in the first six months, i suppose. 
KATE MCKENNA: It' s the first six months that are important. 
don bradley: Edward, what do you think of their packaging? 
EDWARD GREEN: Well, plenty of bright colours. 
It' ll have a lot of impact at point of sale. 
GERALDINE: I' m afraid they are all meeting at the moment. 
No, I' m sorry, I don' t know what time it will finish. 
I' ll put you through to mr. harris' s secretary, and she can make an appointment for you. 
Please hold the line. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Nice to see you again, peter. 
It' s been a long time. 
PETER DAY: How are things at bibury systems? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Very interesting at the moment. 
PETER DAY: I' ve just heard you' re going into partnership with a rather good japanese company. 
CLIVE HARRIS: That' s not exactly true...peter, are you still doing consultancy work? 
PETER DAY: yes. I haven' t retired yet! 
CLIVE HARRIS: Look, can i give you a lift back? 
We haven' t had a chance to chat for a long time. 
DON BRADLEY: What have you found out about their marketing strategy? 
KATE MCKENNA: They have already scheduled a television advertising campaign. 
DON BRADLEY: Who with? 
KATE MCKENNA: e.g.n.c.
KATE MCKENNA: E.G.N.C. The company that they always use. 
DON BRADLEY: When is it scheduled? 
KATE MCKENNA: Something next month, but I haven' t found out the exact date yet. 
DON BRADLEY: Have you heard what they are spending on TV advertising? 
KATE MCKENNA: I don' t know. 
GERALDINE: No, I' m sorry, they are still in a meeting. 
I don' t know how long they' ll be. 
Let me take your number and I will get one of them to call you back. 
PETER DAY: It' s good of you to give me a lift. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It' s no problem. 
Are you still doing consultancy work for J.K. Toys? 
PETER DAY: I wondered why you were going out of your way to give me a lift. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, are you? 
PETER DAY: Technically no. I' ve just finished. 
But that work was confidential. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, of course. 
You could be working for us, you know, I might need a consultant. 
PETER DAY: Really? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, perhaps. 
I might need an idea of the best way to react to Dealer Dan. 
CLIVE HARRIS: A customer. 
Do you know that Dealer Dan is very like a new toy we have developed? 
Dealer Dan could hurt us badly. 
I don' t want any secrets. 
I don' t want to compromise you, I just want some general information. 
PETER DAY: How general? 
KATE MCKENNA: We know their selling price, but what' s their unit cost? 
DON BRADLEY: Derek, what' s your estimate? 
DEREK JONES: I can' t say. 
I don' t know what their production run is. 
We haven' t had that information yet. 
DON BRADLEY: Well, Big Boss' s production run is three hundred thousand. 
Will they produce three hundred thousand? Or more? 
DEREK JONES: I don' t know the answer to that one. 
At that retail price they have to sell a lot of toys. 
DON BRADLEY: It can' t be less than 300 thousand, can it? 
PETER DAY: Thanks for the lift, Clive. 
CLIVE HARRIS: You are something of a specialist in the Far East, aren' t you? 
PETER DAY: You could say that. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, when this deal with this Japanese company is settled, we might need your help. 
We shall need a consultant to help set things up. 
Of course, the success of Big Boss is a very important part of the deal. 
PETER DAY: When might this happen? 
CLIVE HARRIS: That depends. 
PETER DAY: The production run is 300,000 units. 
CLIVE HARRIS: And the advertising budget? 
PETER DAY: Clive, I don' t know. 
Really, I don' t know. 
DON BRADLEY: We haven' t decided on a plan of action yet. 
We must outline a strategy, but first let me summaries what we' re said so far. 
This is a critical situation. 
We know that J.K. Toys are playing to win. 
And we know that right now they have the edge. 
So, let' s look at the down side. 
What are their advantages? 
They have a larger market share; 
they have a cheaper product; 
they have an earlier launch date, 
and we think they have a larger advertising budget. 
KATE MCKENNA: Their strategy is very clear: 
they want our share of the market, both the European market and the export market. 
DON BRADLEY: We cannot let them succeed. 
We have to consider which of these factors we can influence. 
Kate, any ideas? 
KATE MCKENNA: There are two immediate things we can do: 
we can increase our advertising budget and bring forward the launch date. 
DON BRADLEY: Derek, is that feasible? 
DEREK JONES: I don' t think so. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I' ve got some news for you all. 
DON BRADLEY: Okay, just a second.I' ll switch on the speaker. 
Okay, Clive, go ahead. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I' ve got some useful information from Peter Day: 
first of all, I think they' re moving too fast. 
They haven' t done their sums. 
DEREK JONES: Clive, this is Derek. 
Do you know how large their production run' s going to be? 
CLIVE HARRIS: It' s going to be around 300,000 units. 
DEREK JONES: That' s about what we hoped--more than 450,000 and we' ve got problems. 
KATE MCKENNA: This is Kate. I' ve got a question. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Go ahead, Kate. 
KATE MCKENNA: Were you able to find out anything about their overseas marketing strategy? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Well, I' ll tell you this, Kate: 
they won' t crack the American market--we' re a few steps ahead of them there, 
and I want you to exploit that advantage--you need to get out there fast. 
Look I' ll ring off now. 
DON BRADLEY: The most important thing now is to let all of the sales force know about this change in our game plan. 
Jenny, we need to write them at once. 
We need to give them some of the background to this--about what J.K. Toys are planning, 
and about our new marketing strategy--that' s 1. the launch date 2. the price cut. 
And 3. the increased advertising budget. 
3、增加广告预算。
KATE MCKENNA: We need to make it clear that "Big Boss"is an absolute priority. 
DON BRADLEY: Jenny, could you make a draft of that 
and we' ll get it out as soon as possible. 
Edward--you' re been very quite--what else can we do in marketing? 
EDWARD GREEN: We must get into Smith' s catalogue--he' s chosen"Dealer Dan"and he' s decided not to include "Big Boss". 
KATE MCKENNA: I don' t think he' ll change his mind now. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I' ll deal with Mr. Smith--I' ll write to him straight after the meeting and let you have a copy. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Jenny, I' d like to dictate a letter which needs to be faxed as soon as possible to Mr. Smith. 
JENNY ROSS: Right, I' m ready. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Dear Mr. Smith...I have learned that you have decided to select Dealer Dan for your catalogue, instead of Big Boss. 
I understand that your reasons for rejecting "Big Boss"are as follows: 
1. That the unit cost will be 30% higher than the rival product. 
1、我们的产品比竞争对手的单价约高30%。 
2. That the launch date of Big Boss will be three weeks later. 
2、“大老板”的上市日期将迟3个星期。 
3. That J.K. Toys, the manufacturer, will mount an extensive advertising campaign to coincide with the launch date of the product and the mailing date of your catalogue. 
3、J.K.玩具公司将在产品上市日和你的产品目录投递日展开大范围的广告攻势。 
I would like you to reconsider your decision in the light of the following: 
1. Bibury Systems have rescheduled the launch date of Big Boss to January 15th--one week before the planned launch of Dealer Dan. 
1、Bibury系统公司已把“大老板”的上市日期重新定在1月15日－－比“商人丹”的上市要提前一周。 
2. Because of the market profile of your catalogue, we have decided to offer you an extra 2.5% commission on sales through the catalogue in exchange for exclusivity. 
2、由于你的产品目录的市场概况，我们决定通过你的目录而购买我们产品的，我们会给你额外2.5%的佣金，交换条件是我们产品在你的目录里的唯一性。 
3. In addition, Bibury Systems are prepared to offer your customers a discount of 15% on the recommended retail price. 
3、此外，Bibury系统公司准备向你的客户提供在建议零售价基础上给予15%的优惠。 
I am sure that this new information will encourage you to reconsider your decision and include"Big Boss"in your Spring Edition. 
I look forward to receiving your thoughts on this matter. 
Yours sincerely, Clive Harris MD Bibury Systems. 
CLIVE HARRIS: We have direct competition from J.K. Toys. 
We have to make sure that the sales and marketing campaign for Big Boss is the best we have ever done. 
So we are going to have to make an extra effort. 
We have brought the launch date forward to January 15th. 
It will be very tight, but I am sure that we can make this deadline. 
Do you agree? 
So, let' s just outline what we are going to do. 
Kate, I think you should get the sales people in the States together as soon as possible. 
CLIVE HARRIS: You ought to make sure that they understand how important this Big Boss project is. 
KATE MCKENNA: Should I talk to our UK agents as well? 
CLIVE HARRIS: No, I think you ought to leave that to Don. 
KATE MCKENNA: Okay. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, I think you should visit the component suppliers that Don saw last week. 
Confirm that they can meet these new deadlines. 
It抯 essential that they deliver on time, on spec and on price. 
DEREK JONES: Okay. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Don, what are your plans? 
DON BRADLEY: I have arranged to go to see some of our overseas franchise holders next week. 
CLIVE HARRIS: What countries are you going to? 
DON BRADLEY: I' m going to Italy, Egypt and Germany. 
CLIVE HARRISL: I don' t think you should go, Don. 
I think you ought to stay at head office. 
It' s essential that you co-ordinate the new launch strategy. 
DON BRADLEY: Okay. I don' t want to cancel those meetings. 
Could I send Edward? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Do you think he' s ready for that? 
DON BRADLEY: Edward is very capable and I think a little international business travel will broaden his horizons. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Yes, certainly. 
Send Edward, but you ought to brief him very carefully. 
DON BRADLEY: Sure. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Good. I' ll talk to the Bank. 
I' ll try to re-schedule the loan. 
It won' t be easy. 
DON BRADLEY: Geraldine, have you see Edward? 
GERALDINE: He was here a second ago. 
DON BRADLEY: Thanks. 
Jenny, I am not going to be able to make the meeting with the franchise holders next week. 
JENNY BOSS: Oh, I have just finished typing up your itinerary. 
DON BRADLEY: Sorry. 
Ah, Edward, are you interested in a little foreign travel? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes. Very. 
DON BRADLEY: How would you like to go to Italy on Tuesday? 
EDWARD GREEN: That would be very nice. 
DON BRADLEY: Good. And Egypt on Thursday? 
EDWARD GREEN: Oh yes! 
DON BRADLEY: And then back via Frankfurt. 
EDWARD GREEN: How much cash do you think I should take? 
DON BRADLEY: Ah, you don' t have a corporate charge card. 
Cash is going to be a bit of a problem. 
We' ll give you an advance against expenses. 
EDWARD GREEN: Should I entertain any of the clients? 
DON BRADLEY: I' ll give you a full briefing before you go. 
But yes, I don' t see why not. 
You should buy Mr. Lang in Germany a meal. 
We owe him hospitality. 
In fact, he always pays for everything. 
JENNY ROSS: When you get to Italy, Mr. Barbetti, the Assistant Sale Manager, will meet your flight. 
He' ll be at arrivals at Milan airport. 
EDWARD GREEN: How will I know who Mr. Barbetti is? 
JENNY ROSS: I' ll make sure he' s carrying a Bibury Systems brochure. 
DON BRADLEY: Don' t spend too much on room service. 
And get a receipt for everything. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: How may I help you?
KATE MCKENNA: I' d like to send a fax to London, please. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Of course. 
If you could fill out this form and give it back to me, we' ll send it off straight away. 
KATE MCKENNA: And could I buy a street map of Atlanta? 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Please have it with our compliments. 
Have a nice day. 
KATE MCKENNA: Thank you. 
CHECK-IN STEWARD: Thank you. Have a good flight. 
Could I have your ticket and passport, please? 
Good afternoon, Mr. Green. 
Smoking or non-smoking? 
EDWARD GREEN: Non-smoking, please. 
EDWARD GREEN: A window seat, please. 
CHECK-IN STEWARD: And do you have any luggage? 
EDWARD GREEN: Just one suitcase and one piece of hand luggage.
CHECK-IN STEWARD: Put it on the scales, please. 
That' s fine Mr. Green.
Here' s your boarding card.
Boarding at gate 3 in about half an hour.
The duty free lounge is through passport control and turn left.
EDWARD GREEN: Thank you. 
KATE MCKENNA: Hello. Are there any message for me? 
I' m in room 1637. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Yes, Ms. Mckenna, there is a fax here and a telephone message.
KATE MCKENNA: Thank you...Oh and I wonder if you could help me. 
A colleague of mine wants to meet me at this restaurant.
Could you tell me the best way of getting there?
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Well, it' s a five minute walk or you can get a cab.
Would you like us to call a cab for you? 
KATE MCKENNA: That' s very kind of you, but I would like to walk. 
Could you tell me where I am on this map?
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Right.
We are here. The restaurant is there.
So you take a right outside the hotel, here, and it' s a couple of blocks down.
The entrance is just off the side-walk.
KATE MCKENNA: Thank you. 
JENNY ROSS: Edward, did you have a good journey?
EDWARD GREEN: Excellent. 
I brought you back a little souvenir.
JENNY ROSS: Edward! Thank you and how was your meeting with Mr. Lang in Frankfurt?
EDWARD GREEN: Very successful, I think.
JENNY ROSS: Did you go for a meal?
EDWARD GREEN: A very good meal. We had...
JENNY ROSS: And who paid for it?
EDWARD GREEN: I did. Or rather Bibury Systems did.
JENNY ROSS: How did you manage that?
EDWARD GREEN: Just before the bill came, I asked to be excused and then I paid the waiter.
KATE MCKENNA: I' d like to check out, please. 
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Certainly madam.
Have you taken anything from the Minibar this morning?
KATE MCKENNA: No. There are two bags in my room.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: I' ll just call the bell captain.
Here is your final account.
Is something wrong?
KATE McKENNA: No. I' m just not certain what this item refers to.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Ah...let me check...That' s a deposit against the use of the conference facilities on Thursday.
KATE MCKENNA: Oh, I see.
Could I have a separate receipt for that please?
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: Of course, madam.
I' ll just print one out for you.
KATE MCKENNA: And can I just double check that I' m booked in here for two nights, starting Wednesday.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST: That' s right Ms. Mckenna.
We look forward to seeing you again on Wednesday evening. 
KATE MCKENNA: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming this afternoon. 
In the next hour or so I' m going to introduce you to a completely new concept in toy manufacture. 
I shall begin by talking about the market research which led to the development of this product. 
Then I shall explain the technical developments, the production and our marketing strategy. 
Finally I shall outline our recommendations as to how you can make this product a success in your territory. 
By the end of the hour you will be able to see why Bibury Systems are so committed to this new venture and why we so confident that we can capture the American market. 
So let' s begin with the background... 
JENNY ROSS: Can I speak to Phil Watson please? 
PHIL WATSON: Hello, Phil Watson. 
JENNY ROSS: Phil, this is Jenny from the marketing department of Bibury Systems. 
PHIL WATSON: Hi, Jenny. How' s life? 
JENNY ROSS: Complicated. 
I' ve been leaving urgent message for you for the last few days, but you obviously haven' t seen them. 
I am afraid it looks like our competitors, J.K. Toys, have got something that is very similar to Big Boss. 
PHIL WATSON: Oh no. How similar? 
JENNY ROSS: It' s bad news. 
J.K. Toys are launching their product in six weeks time,J.K. 
so we have decided to bring forward our launch date again. 
Can you bring over your designs so Don can see them? 
PHIL WATSON: They' re not finished yet, but I' ll bring everything I have... 
KATE MCKENNA: ...So to sum up, everything indicated that the market was ready for a hi-tech product, 
a product that would appeal to both parents and children, 
a product that lets the user decide the character of the toy. 
Ladies and gentlemen let me introduce a break-through in toy technology. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you "Big Boss" 
BIG BOSS: My name is "Big Boss" 
In six months' time everyone here in the United States of America will be talking about "Big Boss" 
and you, my friends, can take a share in my incredible success. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, I' ve got fifteen minutes. 
That' s all. I have a meeting with the accountant. 
DEREK JONES: I would just like you to take a look. 
It won' t take long. 
It' s a development of Big Boss. 
It' s Big Boss Mark 2. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It looks a bit like Big Boss. 
DEREK JONES: But it has emotions. 
It can cry. It can laugh. 
Not just make the noise. 
Every doll on the market can do that. 
No, Mark 2 can actually make the movements. 
And the gestures. 
It is programmed to look happy, sad, angry or tired at the touch of a button...or ever by voice control. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, I can see you' ve done a lot of work on this. 
It does look ingenious. 
How long has it taken you?
DEREK JONES: Months. I think it' s a real breakthrough. 
CLIVE HARRIS: How difficult will it be to manufacture? 
DEREK JONES: We have new materials here. 
Have you seen the new treated plastics? 
They are very flexible. 
They are much more adaptable than the Big Boss material. 
And we have the technology. 
Take a look at these basic designs. 
I' ll show you what I mean. 
CLIVE HARRIS: It will cost a fortune to develop. 
It will cost three times as much as Big Boss. 
DEREK JONES: Not that much. 
It is an expensive product. 
But Big Boss is selling upmarket. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Let' s see what Don and Kate say, but I think it will cost too much. 
KATE MCKENNA: ...To conclude the presentation we have seen that Big Boss can succeed in the American market. 
We have a product that can give the user more than anything else on the market. 
There is nothing that can touch it. 
Our competitors cannot deliver the technology. 
They cannot match our price and they can' t compete with our television campaign. 
And how much are we spending on this campaign? 
Well, let' s have a look at the individual territories. 
PHIL WATSON: This is the wording, which I agreed with Edward. 
DON BRADLEY: Fine. It' s very clear. 
And I think these colours work very well. 
PHIL WATSON: We' ll have three different photographs of the Boss on the display. 
DON BRADLEY: Yes, I like these two still but I' m not sure about that one. 
PHIL WATSON: There are plenty of options. 
Have a look at these contact sheets. 
DON BRADLEY: How soon will this be camera-ready? 
PHIL WATSON: By next Tuesday. 
DON BRADLEY: I really need this for tomorrow. 
PHIL WATSON: Tomorrow! That' s difficult. 
DON BRADLEY: How difficult? 
PHIL WATSON: It' ll be ready for tomorrow. 
KATE MCKENNA: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. 
But...I would just like to say a few more words...I promise to keep it brief. 
I know that one or two of you have to leave now, but for those who can stay, it' s time to relax. 
We have prepared some refreshments so that you can talk informally about how we can work together to make Big Boss a success. 
The table that' s over there has plenty of food on it! 
And I hope to be able to speak to all of you before you leave. 
And once again, thank you very much for coming. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Don, what are your plans for this weekend? 
DON BRADLEY: Nothing special. Why? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Sakai is back in London for a week before flying home. 
He still hasn' t decided which company he wants to deal with. 
He is interested in Dealer Dan. 
We will have to work hard. 
We have to close this deal. 
He may be free this weekend and a friend of Sakai' s told me he' s a keen golfer. 
Will you be able to offer him a game? 
DON BRADLEY: Yes, I could call him at his hotel. 
KATE MCKENNA: Yes...we know how important the American market is. 
In fact our Chief Executive appointed an American as Director of Marketing and Sales. 
Well, you know Don Bradley...he' s born and bred in Los Angles. 
DON BRADLEY: Ah, Mr. Sakai, this is Don Bradley from Bibury Systems. 
MR. SAKAI: Ah, yes, hello Don. 
DON BRADLEY: How' s your trip going? 
MR. SAKAI: Very well, thank you. 
Hard work, but very useful. 
DON BRADLEY: I hear you play golf? 
MR. SAKAI: That' s right. I do. 
DON BRADLEY: I' m a member of a very good club that' s not far from your hotel. 
Would you care for a round tomorrow? 
MR. SAKAI: Thank you very much, but I have just arranged to visit some tourist sites tomorrow. 
DON BRADLEY: Then how about on Sunday? 
MR. SAKAI: Yes. That' s fine. 
DON BRADLEY: Can I offer you a lift? 
MR. SAKAI: That' s very nice of you. 
DON BRADLEY: Let' s meet in the hotel lobby. 
MR. SAKAI: Fine. 
KATE MCKENNA: Would you excuse me? 
I must just have a quick word with George before he goes. 
George, thank you very much for coming. 
I hope you think it was worth it. 
US SALES AGENT: Kate, it has been a great presentation and a great evening. 
KATE MCKENNA: Well, please stay in touch and let me know how the campaign goes. 
MR. SAKAI: How often do you manage to play golf? 
DON BRADLEY: I like to play twice a week but neither Clive nor I have been able to play in the last three weeks because we抳e been too busy. 
MR. SAKAI: If I could just touch on business for a second... 
DON BRADLEY: Please do. 
MR. SAKAI: Let me be open. 
A rival of Bibury Systems is not only marketing a similar product but is also launching it around the same time. 
Bibury系统公司的一个竞争对手不仅是类似的产品，并且上市的时间也几乎相同。 
DON BRADLEY: Have you seen the rival product? 
DON BRADLEY: Which product would you prefer? 
MR. SAKAI: Personally I like the Boss better. 
MR. SAKAI: Why did you come to the UK? 
DON BRADLEY: My wife is English. 
We lived in America for a while, but she prefers living near her family. 
MR. SAKAI: How did you meet your wife? 
DON BRADLEY: After university I came to Europe to have a short holiday. 
At least that was the plan. 
Within six months I was both married and working for Bibury Systems. 
And I' m still here. 
MR. SAKAI: You must like living in the UK, then? 
DON BRADLEY: At first I thought I would never get used to the weather, but there are lots of good things. 
I love the countryside and I really enjoy going to the theatre. 
MR. SAKAI: Ah, you like the theatre. 
DON BRADLEY: I love the theatre! 
MR. SAKAI: That' s good. 
I was planning to go to the theatre to see 'welfth Night'. 
Do you have any plans for tomorrow evening? 
DON BRADLEY: No, not really. 
MR. SAKAI: If you can spare the time perhaps you and your wife would care to join me. 
DON BRADLEY: Well, I' ll have to check with her, but it sounds like a wonderful idea. 
And after the play you must let us buy you dinner in return. 
MR. SAKAI: See you tomorrow, Don. 
DON BRADLEY: Bye-bye. 
MR. SAKAI: First of all I would like to thank you for your hospitality, your excellent presentations and your patience. 
I' m afraid it has taken me a long time to decide on a European partner, 
but I am sure you will understand that it is a very important decision for Detmore Systems. 
I have looked at all the options, I have talked to my staff in Tokyo and we have decided on Big Boss. 
Ten minutes ago Clive and I shook hands on a provisional agreement. 
10分钟前，克莱夫和我就已经临时协议达成一致。 
There is still a lot of negotiating to do, of course,but I am looking forward to successful partnership with your company 
and I am sure we' ll get to know each other very well over the next few months. 
MR. SAKAI: I' m sorry to have to say this, Clive, but we have got a problem. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Hasn' t the consignment arrived yet? 
We sent them off on... 
MR. SAKAI: No, Clive, you misunderstand me, the consignment arrived two days ago. 
Right on schedule. 
No, the problem is with the product itself. 
CLIVE HARRIS: What is it? 
MR. SAKAI: Last night I had a phone call from one of my warehouse managers. 
He was very excited with the new product. 
He was certain that his son would love one. 
So he took one home, opened it up and switched it on, and heard this... 
CLIVE HARRIS: Do you have any idea how many units are defective? 
MR. SAKAI: We spent the day checking the whole consignment. 
Unfortunately it looks like batch numbers 993 and 994 all have the same problem. 
Everything else seems fine. 
But it was a long job. 
My staff had to check every toy. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Kazo, I will get this sorted out immediately. 
MR. SAKAI: Clive, it is essential that we have these on the shelves by the end of this week. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I am sending Derek Jones over on the first flight. 
And I shall send Don to the suppliers to make sure it won' t happen again. 
DON BRADLEY: There are two hundred fault circuit boards. 
Our product for the far Eastern launch is defective. 
This will damage our reputation in the market place and it' s very embarrassing for us. 
I want to know what you' re going to do to remedy the situation. 
MR. CLAYTON: Mr. Bradley, we have tracked down the problem. 
We can guarantee that it won' t happen again. 
There was a localized problem in quality control which we have isolated and rectified. 
We now have a new Quality Assurance programme. 
DON BRADLEY: That' s all very well but you have failed to meet the terms of the contract. 
I am afraid we have no option. 
We will have to terminate the contract and find a new supplier. 
MR. CLAYTON: Mr. Bradley, I understand your concern and recognise that it' s a very unsatisfactory situation, 
but may I point out it was just two batches that were defective... 
DON BRADLEY: It may have been just two batches but we now have two hundred defective products on the market with the Bibury name on them. 
MR. CLAYTON: Mr. Bradley, we appreciate that the situation has damaged your reputation. 
And we are very sorry. 
But we also have a good reputation. 
And that reputation is built upon reliability and good relationships with our customers. 
We supply many leading companies and we are very embarrassed by this incident. 
I must assure you that it won' t happen again. 
DON BRADLEY: How can I be certain that it won' t happen again? 
JENNY ROSS: Hello, this is Bibury Systems. 
The fax machine that we hired from you has broken down. 
The paper keeps jamming. 
It hasn' t worked properly since you installed it. 
We would like someone to come and fix it now. 
Look, I spoke to someone three hours ago. 
They said an engineer would come before lunchtime. 
But in the service agreement it says that you will send someone within twenty-four hours. 
We need it fixed today. 
Well, if you can' t get it repaired today then we will have to cancel our rental agreement. 
KATE MCKENNA: Hello! 
JENNY ROSS: Welcome back. 
I hear the American launch was a great success. 
KATE MCKENNA: I think we' ve cracked it. 
Orders for Big Boss are right on target. 
And I had a wonderful holiday. 
For a few weeks I managed to stop thinking about Big Boss. 
So how have things been here? 
Is this post mine? 
JENNY ROSS: No. This is yours. 
You haven' t heard the news? 
KATE MCKENNA: What' s happened? 
JENNY ROSS: There' s a problem with the circuitry on some of the units that went to Japan last week. 
KATE MCKENNA: What!! 
JENNY ROSS: Derek flew to Tokyo to look at the problem. 
KATE MCKENNA: So it' s serious. 
JENNY ROSS: Yes. And Don' s gone to the component supplier to find out how it happened. 
We think we have tracked the problem down to just two batches, but... 
KATE MCKENNA: I don' t believe this. Where' s Clive? 
JENNY ROSS: He' s in a meeting. 
KATE MCKENNA: Jenny, I need to talk to him as soon as possible. 
I' ve negotiated sales of over 80,000 units to the States... 
DON BRADLEY: We have three options. 
We can re-negotiate with Southford Components or we can work with MAGL or Parkview. 
CLIVE HARRIS: A crucial factor is how quickly they can deliver. 
DEREK JONES: MAGL certainly claim to be the fastest. 
But I' m worried that although they are fast they may not have the best quality control. 
CLIVE HARRIS: And quality control was the problem with Southford Components. 
DEREK JONES: Exactly. Although they have promised that their system is improved. 
DON BRADLEY: Looking at these quotations, I don' t think Parkview are the best option. 
They offer a very fast delivery time, they have a very high reputation and they are the nearest supplier to the assembly line. 
But they are very expensive compared with Southford. 
DEREK JONES: Don, price can' t be a factor at this stage. 
DON BRADLEY: I don' t agree with you. 
I think we have to get the best service at the best price. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I think we can re-negotiate a far better deal with Southford Components. 
But we must move fast...Come in. 
KATE MCKENNA: Clive, what on earth' s going on? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Welcome back, Kate. 
KATE MCKENNA: I' ve just spent weeks selling Big Boss in the States and now I find out there' s something wrong with it. 
Why didn't anyone tell me? 
CLIVE HARRIS: We only discovered this yesterday. 
And we' re fairly sure that none of the defective circuits went to the States. 
Now, I spoke to New York ten minute ago. 
They' re running a check. 
They' re ringing back tomorrow. 
All the signs are that it is just those two batches in Japan. 
MR. SMITH: I want to speak to Edward Green right away...please. 
GERALDINE: Do you have an appointment, sir? 
KATE MCKENNA: The Boss isn' t doing as well as we had hoped. 
We didn' t launch at the right time. 
I myself don' t think the market was ready for us. 
Dealer Dan came later and cheaper...Maybe we should move downmarket in a couple of key territories. 
EDWARD GREEN: Excuse me, can I interrupt? 
DON BRADLEY: Sure. 
EDWARD GREEN: I' ve just had a call from Danny Mcneil at Eromart. 
KATE MCKENNA: Oh really? 
EDWARD GREEN: He wants a meeting to discuss discounts. 
Although he' s talking about a substantial order, he wants better terms than I can authorise. 
Would you prefer to deal with him yourself? 
DON BRADLEY: How larger a discount does he want? 
EDWARD GREEN: He didn' t say. 
But I think it' s higher than anything we' ve ever given before. 
He loved the product, though. 
I think he' s ready to negotiate. 
DON BRADLEY: I think it' s time that we worked on this together. 
Do you agree? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes! 
KATE MCKENNA: Edward, are you coming down to the workshop? 
Derek wants to show us his latest idea. 
EDWARD GREEN: Okay. I' ll join you later. 
DON BRADLEY: No, I think Derek wants to talk to the whole team. 
Come on! 
KATE MCKENNA: Well, it' s a terrific idea, but how much will it cost to develop? 
DEREK JONES: Not as much as you think. 
KATE MCKENNA: It will be too expensive. 
DEREK JONES: No, not really. 
I have prepared a long, detailed, careful analysis of the development costs. 
See for yourself. 
KATE MCKENNA: It will never sell. 
Who' s the market for this? 
DEREK JONES: It is more upmarket than Big Boss but it will still appeal to kids as well as executives and office workers. 
KATE MCKENNA: But that' s the problem Derek. 
There' s no market focus. 
Do you remember the Easirite two years ago? 
We had a beautiful well-designed but expensive product. 
It was great. 
Parents and children could both use it. 
But could we sell it? 
No, it failed because we hadn' t defined our market. 
DEREK JONES: But this is different. 
This is more fun than Easirite. 
DON BRADLEY: The costings look okay, but it has too many moving parts. 
DEREK JONES: So does a car, but that seems to sell. 
KATE MCKENNA: That' s not the point. 
The more moving parts you have the more likely something will go wrong 
DEREK JONES: I don' t agree. 
DON BRADLEY: Let抯' s just hold on a second and think about this. 
Derek, you like the concept and think it will sell; Kate, you can' t see a market for it. 
KATE MCKENNA: I can' t see where it fits in our product range. 
DON BRADLEY: I' m inclined to agree with Kate. 
This is much more expensive than anything else we market. 
KATE MCKENNA: Although it' s a wonderful idea, we just won' t be able to sell it. 
You must see that yourself, Derek. 
DEREK JONES: Well not really... 
DON BRADLEY: Edward, what do you think? 
EDWARD GREEN: Can I just check something here Derek? 
Are you saying that there is a plastic thin enough and flexible enough to make this realistic? 
DEREK JONES: Exactly. 
EDWARD GREEN: That' s brilliant. 
On paper, I think it' s the most remarkable thing I' ve seen. 
DON BRADLEY: Well, maybe Edward has something. 
Maybe we ought to have a closer look. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I don' t know what' s happened to your boss. 
He knows I never start my meetings late. 
Do you want to wait here for Don or would you rather look around? 
EDWARD GREEN: If it' s alright with you, I' d like to look around. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Good choice. 
DANNY McNEIL: Of course, I have two or three meetings a day with sales people like you. 
EDWARD GREEN It' s very good of you to see me. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I always talk to my suppliers myself--it' s the best way of working. 
And I always prefer to bring them down here--they get a better idea of our operation. 
They must understand how we work. 
Our success is based upon a certain formula. 
Whereas most supermarkets target individual territories, our products are pan-European. 
We always buy in the products with the best sales performance--products with a proven track record. 
We look for the biggest discounts, and we usually get them. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Mcneil. 
DON BRADLEY: Danny, it' s Don Bradley here. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Good Morning, Don. 
I thought I was meeting you here. 
DON BRADLEY: I' m sorry Danny. 
That was the plan, but I' m going to be late. 
This meeting is taking longer than expected. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Oh. When can you get here? 
DON BRADLEY: I' ll be there as soon as I can. 
Is Edward with you? 
DANNY MCNEIL: He is. 
DON BRADLEY: Could you start the meeting without me? 
Edward knows the situation. 
Oh, and can I have a quick word with him? 
DANNY MCNEIL: I' ll pass the phone to him. 
DANNY McNEIL: Okay. It' s for you--it抯 Don Bradley, he抯 got a problem. 
EDWARD GREEN: Oh, thanks. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Would you like a word in private? 
EDWARD GREEN: If you don' t mind. 
DON BRADLEY: Sorry Edward. 
I' m stuck in a meeting here. 
You' ll have to deal with Mcneil by yourself. 
EDWARD GREEN: Oh. 
DON BRADLEY: Can you talk? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, he' s stepped away for a few minutes. 
Do you really want me to negotiate? 
Wouldn' t you rather postpone the meeting? 
DON BRADLEY: How do you feel about it? 
EDWARD GREEN: I' m happy to go ahead, I think. 
DON BRADLEY: You don' t sound sure. 
EDWARD GREEN: I' m not. 
DON BRADLEY: Look: we' ve talked about this negotiation. 
You know the game plan. 
Do your best...I' ll be there as soon as I can. 
EDWARD GREEN: Okay Don. 
I' ll do what I can. See you later. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Okay? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, thanks. 
DANNY MCNEIL: So Don can' t make it. 
Oh well, right, what was I saying? 
Oh yes: discounts. 
EDWARD GREEN: We' re certainly happy to talk about possible discounts. 
DANNY MCNEIL: You see this? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes. 
DANNY MCNEIL: How many of these do you think we' ve sold in Europe in the last month? 
EDWARD GREEN: 1,800 - 2,000. 
DANNY McNEIL: We sell more than that weekly. 
EDWARD GREEN: How much do you sell it for? 
DANNY MCNEIL: This retails in France for 130 FF--we sell it much cheaper--90FF. 
EDWARD GREEN: That' s very impressive. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I work on higher volumes and I have to move products faster than any other retailer. 
That means I operate on smaller margins. 
And, I repeat, I expect the largest discounts in the industry. 
But over here--here' s a product that failed. 
We made a mistake with this one--of course, I didn' t select this one myself. 
Right you' ve seen how our operation works. 
You know what I' m after. 
Let' s get down to business. 
Would you prefer to talk here or in my office? 
EDWARD GREEN: The office is fine. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Before we begin, are you sure that you are in a position to conduct this negotiation? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, I have the authority to negotiate with you. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Right. Let' s get down to business. 
EDWARD GREEN: Which of our product lines are you particularly interested in Mr. McNeil? 
DANNY MCNEIL: I could be interested in these ones that I have outlined here. 
But I want to hear what you say about discounts. 
EDWARD GREEN: Let' s talk specifically about Big Boss. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Let' s be clear about one thing. 
I hope you realize that we must have a much larger discount than what' s on the table now. 
EDWARD GREEN: I think the discount problem can be resolved but you need to be more precise about numbers. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Fair enough. 
What kind of discount are you offering on ten thousand units? 
EDWARD GREEN: On ten thousand units, Mr. Mcneil, I can offer a discount of thirty percent. 
But I can' t offer more 
DANNY MCNEIL: 30 per cent! 
EDWARD GREEN: Just let me finish, 30 percent, but with a guarantee of delivery within two months. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Delivery must be within two months or I' m not interested. 
I' m offering you the chance to make a very large sale and you are turning it down because we' re... 
EDWARD GREEN: Can I just come in here Mr. McNeil? 
I haven' t turned anything down. 
I haven' t said "no". 
I am just saying that on ten thousand units our discount terms are thirty percent. 
DANNY MCNEIL: But... 
EDWARD GREEN: Please let me finish. 
Now if you commit to buy twenty thousand units then I could consider a larger discount. 
DANNY MCNEIL: How much larger? 
EDWARD GREEN: If you commit to twenty thousand units then I can offer a thirty-five percent discount. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Thirty, thirty five percent. 
I' m getting tired of this. 
You are playing games. 
I am looking for a large discount, and I hope that you' re going to offer me one. 
EDWARD GREEN: If you want a big discount then you must make the order a big one. 
Let' s talk about unit price rather than discount. 
Our standard unit price to the wholesaler is 23.5. 
DANNY MCNEIL: And I' m not interested in 23.5. 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, I know that Mr. McNeil. 
If you buy 40,000 units, then I can offer a unit price of 19.5. 
What will your mark-up be on the Boss, 3, 3.5, 4? 
DANNY MCNEIL: About that. 
EDWARD GREEN: With those figures you' re going to be very competitive. 
DANNY MCNEIL: 19.5 unit price? 
EDWARD GREEN: If you buy 40,000 units; that represents a discount of... 
I can see what the discount is. 
Offer me a unit price of 19.5 on 25,000 units and we can do business. 
EDWARD GREEN: I can' t do that. I' m sorry. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Let' s break for a few minutes. 
I' ve got a few things I have to see to. 
I' ll be a couple of minutes. 
Would you like a cup of coffee? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes, please. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Help yourself to the phone if you want to make a call. 
EDWARD: Thanks. 
DON BRADLEY: Don Bradley. 
EDWARD GREEN: Hi, Don. How' s the meeting? 
DON BRADLEY: It' s just finished. 
I' m on my way over. How' s your meeting? 
EDWARD GREEN: he' s definitely interested. 
We' re having a break. 
DON BRADLEY: What' s the situation? 
EDWARD GREEN: It' s becoming difficult, we' re stuck on the size of the order for Big Boss. 
He wants a unit price of 19.5 on an order of 25,000. 
DON BRADLEY: That sounds good to me. 
EDWARD GREEN: I think we can push him further. 
DON BRADLEY: Do you think so? 
EDWARD GREEN: I think so...I hope so. 
DON BRADLEY: Be careful. He' s a clever man. 
I've dealt with Mcneil before. 
When he starts banging on the table, that' s as far as you can go with him. 
Good luck! 
EDWARD GREEN: Thanks. So let' s clarify the position so far. 
As far as Big Boss is concerned we have agreed on a unit price of 20 for 30,000, and I can' t go below that price for an order of this size. 
Now let' s look at terms of payment. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Ninety days. 
EDWARD GREEN: I' m sorry Mr. Mcneil, but that' s completely unacceptable. 
Our standard policy on discounts of over thirty percent is payment within thirty days of delivery. 
DANNY MCNEIL: This is not a standard situation. 
I am making a very large order... 
EDWARD GREEN: Can I just come in here, Mr. Mcneil? 
I know you' re making a large order but you are also getting an excellent product at a very large discount. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I can' t believe that this is your final offer. 
EDWARD GREEN: If you order 35,000 then I can authorise payment in 90 days. 
DANNY MCNEIL: We have already decided on quantity. 
This is my last offer. 30,000 at 60 days payment. 
Take it or leave it. 
EDWARD GREEN: I think that offer will be acceptable. 
So all we have to do now is finalise the delivery arrangements. 
DANNY McNEIL: Well, let' s discuss the details tomorrow. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Come in! Don, how are you? 
DON BRADLEY: Hello, Danny, Edward. 
I' m sorry I' m late. 
DANNY MCNEIL: You are late. 
I' d rather do business with you than this young man. 
What have you been feeding him? 
DON BRADLEY: Oh, we don' t feed him. 
We like to keep our staff hungry. 
DON BRADLEY: I' d like you to look at those figures: 
As you can see, the maximum retail price for the Mark 2 must be 60. 
That means, that to keep our margins, our production costs must be no more than 14 per unit. 
DEREK JONES: I' d rather have a retail price of 75. 
I don' t believe that the Mark 2 can be produced for less than 18 per unit. 
DON BRADLEY: That retail price is not a realistic option, Derek. 
We' ve done the research. 
DEREK JONES: But it' s not just a toy. This is a genuine breakthrough. 
DON: Derek... 
DEREK JONES: Let me finish--this is a genuine breakthrough and the market will be prepared to pay a premium price for something that is so advanced. 
DON BRADLEY: Derek, let me... 
DEREK JONES: Just a minute. 
There is nothing like this on the market, we have to take a chance with it. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, I don' d like arguing with you, but I have to agree with Don. 
I' m sorry, we can' t take the risk. 
I say we retail at 60 and produce at 14. 
DEREK JONES: No manufacturer will be able to produce the Mark 2 for 14 per unit and maintain the quality. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I would rather not decide anything now. 
DEREK JONES: I would like to show it to Hazelford Systems. 
They might be able to produce it for 15 or 16. 
KATE MCKENNA: Jenny, could you do something about this fax machine? 
Phone the company, cancel the rental agreement and get the best deal you can from another firm. 
I' m sick of this. 
JENNY ROSS: Hello. This is Jenny Ross of Bibury Systems. 
We hired a fax machine from you and I would like to cancel our rental agreement. 
No, I' m sorry. 
I would rather just cancel the agreement ... 
No, we did ask you to send someone yesterday and it still isn' t working properly. 
I' m sorry, but I have to say no. 
Yes, if you could send someone to collect it tomorrow morning, please. 
DANNY MCNEIL: Now let' s turn to the Big Boss. 
What is the soonest you can deliver? 
EDWARD GREEN: You can have the first five thousand units before the end of the month. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I want ten thousand by the end of the month. 
EDWARD GREEN: Well, Mr. Mcneil, that will be difficult, 
but as you have been so understanding over the question of price, I think we can arrange that. 
DANNY MCNEIL: What about the balance of the order? 
EDWARD GREEN: We can deliver that in three consignments over the following three months. 
DANNY MCNEIL: I' d rather have everything delivered by the end of May. 
EDWARD GREEN: I can' t promise to do that, but I shall do my best. 
MS WONG: First of all, let me welcome all the representatives of Bibury Systems. 
I' d like to say that we at Hazelford Systems are delighted that you are considering us as a future supplier. 
Perhaps I could begin by checking that everyone has a copy of the agenda? 
And I' d like to add one extra item, if I may ?could we discuss the question of exchange procedures after item four, 
which looks at general payment conditions? 
So let' s make a start. 
Mr. Jones, would you like to outline your position on the first item on the agenda: technological specifications? 
DEREK JONES: Thank you. 
I think that we need to consider a couple of options when we look at this question... 
You can sign the contract when we deliver the machine. 
JENNY ROSS: How soon can we expect delivery? 
FAX REP: Well, would next Tuesday be convenient? 
JENNY ROSS: No, we really need it today. 
FAX REP: I' m afraid that' s just not possible. 
JENNY ROSS: Well, what is the earliest you can deliver? 
FAX REP: We can' t do it before Friday afternoon. 
JENNY ROSS: Well, I' m afraid we really need the machine by tomorrow at the latest or I' m going to have to look elsewhere. 
FAX REP: Okay, I' ll see what I can do. 
JENNY ROSS: I' m sorry but that just isn' t good enough. 
FAX REP: I' ll need to speak to my boss. 
Can I call you back in ten minutes? 
MS WONG: I' m sorry. 
This is a very difficult situation. 
I understand your problem, but you must see our position. 
We think this is a very exciting project, 
but because we cannot find a compromise I' m afraid we can go no further. 
CLIVE HARRIS: We cannot go higher than 14 for 30,000 units. 
That is our final offer. 
MS WONG: But you must realise that at this price our margin is unacceptable. 
So, I think we have covered all the items on today' s agenda, 
I am sorry that we have reached no solution on the final item which is the Mark 2 project. 
Could I suggest that we adjourn for today and meet tomorrow morning at ten o' clock? 
JENNY ROSS: Is Clive back yet? 
GERALDINE: He phoned about twenty minutes ago--said he was on his way. 
He didn' t sound very happy. 
JENNY ROSS: Oh dear. 
I wanted to ask him about taking a couple of days off. 
GERALDINE: I' d suggest that you wait. 
I don' t think that... 
GERALDINE: Oh, Mr. Harris there' s a message from... 
CLIVE HARRIS: Geraldine, I' m in a meeting with Derek. 
Hold all my calls. 
JENNY ROSS: I see what you mean! 
GERALDINE: I' ve never seen Derek look so angry. 
What' s going on? 
JENNY ROSS: I don' t know. 
Have they had an argument? 
KATE MCKENNA:Well! That was an interesting journey! 
Twenty minutes of total silece. 
JENNY ROSS: What' s going on? 
KATE MCKENNA: I think the word to describe the situation is"eadlock". 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, you are being unreasonable. 
DEREK JONES: Me? Why won' t you move on fourteen? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, we have been through this. 
We have agreed our negotiating position. 
DEREK JONES: I have never agreed to this position. 
We aren' t offering any flexibility.
They have to protect their margins. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Then we can' t do the project. 
DEREK JONES: That' s your decision, is it? 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, I have no choice. 
DEREK JONES: I'm sorry Clive. I can' t accept that. 
CLIVE HARRIS: What are you saying? 
DEREK JONES: I' m giving in my resignation. 
CLIVE HARRIS: That' s ridiculous. 
You' re tired. Sleep on it and we' ll talk in the morning. 
DEREK JONES: I have been with Bibury Systems for twelve years. 
I have given the company 100% commitment. 
I feel very disappointed that you are unable to support me on this project.
I know that the Mark 2 will work and it will sell. 
I intend to start looking for a company that values new ideas. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Derek, there must be a way round this. 
I know how you feel. 
And I do value your contribution. 
To prove it I' m going to increase your research budget... 
DEREK JONES: That' s not the point, Clive... 
DEREK JONES: That' s not the point, Clive...
Yes, put her through Sally--good morning. 
Yes, he is. 
Just a minute. 
It' s Sally Wong. She wants to talk to you. 
DON BRADLEY: Edward, I' ve looked through the draft contract with Eromart. 
I see you' ve covered packaging, insurance, late delivery penalties... 
and you did well to make him agree to be more flexible over terms of payment. 
Well done. Now we can get the contract finalised. 
EDWARD GREEN: Before I go, can we have a chat? 
DON BRADLEY: Sure. What about? 
EDWARD GREEN: Don, I have been with Bibury Systems for 6 months now, and I' d like to talk about my future. 
MS WONG: I' m terribly sorry to ask you to come here early, but I have a proposal that could benefit both of us. 
Could I suggest that we look at these designs again? 
Particularly I want you to look at the interface between the release mechanism and the scanner. 
I believe that we can make the process simpler. 
DEREK JONES: No. I have been through this many times. 
MS WONG: I am sorry, if you could just bear with me a second... 
I spent all last night worrying about this. 
I believe the conclusion of yesterday' s meeting was very unfortunate. 
I wanted to find a way forward and I think I have. 
The scanner does not need to be powered from the same source. 
That means it can be produced separately. 
DEREK JONES: No, no, no, it' s... 
You' re right. 
This is brilliant. 
MS WONG: It' s really very simple. 
DON BRADLEY: Is there a problem? 
Aren' t you happy here? 
EDWARD GREEN: Yes. But I would like to know what plans you have for me. 
I feel I' ve made good progress here over the last six months. 
What do you think? 
DON BRADLEY: I agree. 
We' re very happy with what you have done. 
Of course you did make a few mistakes, especially early on,
but generally I see you as an important part of the team and I' m sure Kate ges along with that. 
EDWARD GREEN: That' s good to hear, thank you. 
EDWARD GREEN: That' s good to hear, thank you. 
I feel I' ve learned a lot here in the last six months. 
Obviously six months ago I couldn' t have negotiated a large deal with Eronmart...but now I can. 
DON BRADLEY: Let' s be open here, Edward. 
Are we talking about salary? 
EDWARD GREEN: It' s not just a question of money Don. 
I want to look at the whole package. 
It' s salary, performance-related bonus, a company charge card, an expense account, a car, and a more responsible position. 
DON BRADLEY: I think we should sit down, don' t you? 
MS WONG: I am very happy that we have been able to overcome the difficulties. 
I think our negotiations have been very successful and as a result we are in a position to move forward with his project. 
CLIVE HARRIS: I would like to thank Sally Wong for her outstanding contribution to this project. 
DEREK JONES: Here, here. 
CLIVE HARRIS: She has worked very hard to find a solution to what seemed an impossible problem. 
MS WONG: Thank you. I think the Mark 2 is a very exciting concept. 
Perhaps we should spend some time summarizing and clarifying what we have agreed... 
DON BRADLEY: Edward, if you insist on the car then I can' t offer you such a large salary increase, 
and we' ll have to find some compromise on the performance-related bonus. 
EDWARD GREEN: I think I am worth the salary. 
DON BRADLEY: I' m prepared to offer you a larger bonus, but if you accept that, then you have to accept a smaller salary increase. 
EDWARD GREEN: Could you be more precise? 
DON BRADLEY: If you accept a fifteen percent increase in salary then I can add an extra five percent on that bonus figure. 
That represents a forty percent increase next year. 
If you make your targets. 
EDWARD GREEN: Okay, if you make that a seventeen percent salary increase, I think we can reach agreement. 
DON BRADLEY: Okay. 
CLIVE HARRIS: Sally, we very much appreciate your efforts to make this product possible. 
I have a small token of our gratitude which I would like you to have. 
MS WONG: This is very kind of you. 
EDWARD GREEN: Which just leaves the matter of the car. 
DON BRADLEY: But Edward, I said the salary increase was conditional on you making a concession on the car. 
EDWARD GREEN: I' ll accept a smaller car. 
DON BRADLEY: Alright. 
Now let' s go through these points once more. 
Clive is going to kill me. 
Where did you learn to negotiate, Edward? 
EDWARD GREEN: You taught me everything I know, Don. 
JENNY ROSS: Good night Geraldine. 
GERALDINE: Good night.
